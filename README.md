# Vehicle CO2 Emission Prediction Model


This repository contains a machine learning model developed to predict CO2 emissions from vehicle engine sizes using linear regression.

## Overview

The model utilizes the `sklearn` library in Python to build a linear regression model based on a dataset of engine sizes and corresponding CO2 emissions in Canada. It aims to provide a predictive tool for estimating CO2 emissions based on vehicle engine characteristics.

## Features

- **Linear Regression Model:** Implements the `LinearRegression` class from `sklearn.linear_model` to establish a linear relationship between engine size and CO2 emissions.
  
- **Data Preparation:** The model is trained on a dataset (`FuelComsuptionCo2.csv`) where engine sizes (`ENGINESIZE`) and CO2 emissions (`CO2EMISSIONS`) are extracted and converted into numpy arrays for training.

- **Scalability:** Designed to handle large datasets efficiently, accommodating diverse vehicle types and engine configurations.

### Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- `Python 3.x`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<idaraabasiudoh>/vehicle-co2-emission-prediction.git
cd vehicle-co2-emission-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
