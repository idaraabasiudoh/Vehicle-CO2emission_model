## Introduction
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting CO2 emissions from various vehicles using a multiple linear regression model. The project leverages Python and popular data science libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
- To implement a linear regression model using scikit-learn to predict CO2 emissions.
- To train, test, and evaluate the model on a dataset of vehicle specifications and CO2 emissions.
- To explore the relationship between different vehicle features and their CO2 emissions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project, `FuelConsumptionCo2.csv`, contains model-specific fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light-duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada. The dataset includes the following columns:
- `MODELYEAR`: e.g., 2014
- `MAKE`: e.g., Acura
- `MODEL`: e.g., ILX
- `VEHICLE CLASS`: e.g., SUV
- `ENGINE SIZE`: e.g., 4.7
- `CYLINDERS`: e.g., 6
- `TRANSMISSION`: e.g., A6
- `FUEL CONSUMPTION in CITY (L/100 km)`: e.g., 9.9
- `FUEL CONSUMPTION in HWY (L/100 km)`: e.g., 8.9
- `FUEL CONSUMPTION COMB (L/100 km)`: e.g., 9.2
- `CO2 EMISSIONS (g/km)`: e.g., 182

### Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- `Python 3.x`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`

## Installation
To run this project locally, you need to have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the necessary packages using the following command:

Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/idaraabasiudoh/vehicle-co2-emission-prediction.git
cd vehicle-co2-emission-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To use this repository, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/idaraabasiudoh/vehicle-co2-emission-prediction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd vehicle-co2-emission-prediction
    ```
3. Run the prediction script:
    ```bash
    python predict.py
    ```

## Modeling
The modeling process involves the following steps:
1. **Data Exploration**: Understanding the dataset by visualizing and summarizing the data.
2. **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
3. **Model Training**: Using the training set to train a linear regression model.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared score.

## Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using the test dataset. The key metrics used for evaluation include:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: This is the mean of the absolute value of the errors. It is an easy-to-understand metric representing the average error between the predicted and actual values.
    ```python
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error
    mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)
    print("Mean Absolute Error (MAE):", mae)
    ```

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: This is the mean of the squared errors. It is a popular metric because it gives more weight to larger errors, which can be useful when large errors are particularly undesirable.
    ```python
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    print("Mean Squared Error (MSE):", mse)
    ```

- **R-squared Score**: This metric indicates how well the data points fit the regression line. An R-squared score of 1.0 means the model perfectly explains the variance in the target variable.
    ```python
    from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
    r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
    print("R-squared Score:", r2)
    ```

### Example Code
Here is an example of how to evaluate the model using these metrics:
```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error, r2_score

# Assuming y_test contains the actual values and y_pred contains the predicted values
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

print("Mean Absolute Error (MAE):", mae)
print("Mean Squared Error (MSE):", mse)
print("R-squared Score:", r2)
```
